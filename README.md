# Github Finder App

### This is a project to continue practicing React.js.

## Learnings

### useContext, useReducer

Instead of using useState, I got to practice on working with the useContext and useReducer Hook. Having previously learned Redux to manage global state, it made me realize that these hooks are ideal for smaller projects if you want to manage/access your state globally.

### Tailwind CSS & Daisy UI

This was my first time to implement a 3rd party library to handle css.
I've always been using SCSS or pure css in my practice projects. I'm hoping to implement it more in the future, although using a lot of classes does take getting used to.
